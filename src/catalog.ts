/**
 * Model catalogue owner: the models.dev `opencode.models` dictionary is the
 * source of truth for WHICH free models exist, while Zen's `/models` stays the
 * availability gate (a model models.dev calls free can still be unserved).
 *
 * Three layers, deliberately separable so each failure mode is attributable:
 *   1. derivation (pure): free test, activity test, channel inference, metadata
 *      mapping — no I/O, fully fixture-testable;
 *   2. fetch + cache: one conditional GET of the 5.2MB `api.json` (models.dev
 *      publishes no per-provider endpoint), storing ONLY the models dictionary
 *      so a warm start never re-downloads it;
 *   3. the state container: TTL, single-flight, degradation, and the Zen gate.
 *
 * DSH never calls `provider.refreshModels` (no host caller exists), so this
 * module owns its own trigger. It is host-side only: no DSH `ctx` concepts live
 * here, lifecycle wiring stays in `index.ts`.
 *
 * Identity (`provider` / `baseUrl` / `headers`) is NOT defined here — it is
 * inherited from `template`, an already identity-mapped pi-ai record, so the
 * Zen identity constants keep exactly one owner in `zen-provider.ts` and no
 * import cycle is introduced.

 * by tests — iterating a bare string turns it into a set of single characters,
 * i.e. a well-typed, well-formed, entirely wrong gate), and an empty list
 * (`fetchZenModelIds` already collapses one to null, but the invariant belongs
 * here, not at the state.source).
 *
 * DISJOINT is the fourth, and the one a list-emptiness check misses. A response
 * that is perfectly well-formed and names NONE of the state.models we hold is far more
 * likely to be a changed shape, a wrong egress, or a different tenant than it is
 * to be a simultaneous withdrawal of every free model — and acting on it empties
 * the picker outright, which is the one outcome this decision exists to prevent.
 * Found by review 2026-09-30, after the `[]` guard shipped believing it was
