 *   2. fetch + cache: one conditional GET of the 5.2MB `api.json` (models.dev

 *   3. the state container: TTL, single-flight, degradation, and the Zen gate.
 *
 * DSH never calls `provider.refreshModels` (no host caller exists), so this

 * The ONE rule for "may this answer narrow the gate?".
 *
 * Three shapes are "could not tell", and all three must leave the gate alone:
 * a failure (null), a non-array (this seam is also filled by a host refresh and
 * by tests — iterating a bare string turns it into a set of single characters,
 * i.e. a well-typed, well-formed, entirely wrong gate), and an empty list
 * (`fetchZenModelIds` already collapses one to null, but the invariant belongs
 * here, not at the state.source).
 *
 * DISJOINT is the fourth, and the one a list-emptiness check misses. A response
 * that is perfectly well-formed and names NONE of the state.models we hold is far more
 * likely to be a changed shape, a wrong egress, or a different tenant than it is
 * to be a simultaneous withdrawal of every free model — and acting on it empties
 * the picker outright, which is the one outcome this decision exists to prevent.
 *after the `[]` guard shipped believing it was
 * sufficient.
 *
 * This was previously written TWICE — once in `refreshGate`, once in
 * `applyZenGate` — and only the first was ever executed, so "change one, forget
 * the other" would have accumulated silently until some future host actually
 * called `refreshModels`. One owner, both callers.
