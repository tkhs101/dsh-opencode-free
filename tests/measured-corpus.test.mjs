/**
 * Replay of every measurement taken against Zen on 2026-10-06.
 *
 * This file exists because two shipped classifiers looked correct and were not.
 * `thinkingLevelMapFor` returning `undefined` read as "no claim" when pi-ai
 * reads it as "offer everything"; a per-sample `reasoning_tokens === 0` test
 * flipped on big-pickle's 0-versus-8 alternation and could never converge.
 * Neither was caught by a unit test, because both were tested on hand-picked
 * inputs rather than on what the provider actually returned.
 *
 * So the corpus is the provider's own answers, keyed by the question each one
 * asked. A classifier that disagrees with the field fails here.
